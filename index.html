        <p>Max Globokar is a professional juggler and unicycle enthusiast but he absolutely isn't a clown. After losing his dog in a clown accident at a 
          young age, he has since distanced himself from the profession, trying to change the face of a dying industry by rebranding himself as a "professional musician." 
          He has toured with many of the greats, such as a world tour with both Mr. Tumble and Toto. He is a seasoned jazz guitarist and a world-renowned tin whistle player. 
          Max is an original member of Plunger Award, following them on many world tours, most recently the "Poop Tour."</p>
