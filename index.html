		<p>Max Globokar is a professional juggler and unicycle enthusiast but he absolutely isn't a clown. After losing his dog in a clown accident at young age, he has since distanced himself from the profession, trying to change the face of a dying industry by rebranding himself as a "professional musician". He has toured with many of the greats such as a world tour with both Mr Tumble and Toto. He is a seasoned jazz guitarist and a world renowned tin whistle player. Max is an original member of Plunger Award, following them on many world tours, most recently the "poop tour"</p>
