            <p>Max Globokar is a professional juggler and unicycle enthusiast but he absolutely isn't a clown. After losing his dog in a clown accident at a 
              young age, he has since distanced himself from the profession, trying to change the face of a dying industry by rebranding himself as a "professional musician." 
              He has toured with many of the greats, such as a world tour with both Mr. Tumble and Toto. He is a seasoned jazz guitarist and a world-renowned tin whistle player. 
              Max is an original member of Plunger Award, following them on many world tours, most recently the "Poop Tour."</p>

            <p>Paige Birgenheier is a musician who sings sometimes when she feels like it. She spends most of her time crying and eating ramen, but when she feels like being a human, 
               she likes to write her own songs with her imaginary roommate while doing trapeze.</p>

            <p>He has experienced being a freshman four times — once in the Philippines, once in Korea, once in Minnesota, and then spent two years in the military. 
               Now, for the first time, he’s been attending a university for over a year. This time, he's hoping to finally graduate this college.</p>
